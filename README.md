# Node.js Backend Project: Vidly - Online Video Store

# Project Overview:
"Vidly" is a robust Node.js backend project designed to power an online video store platform. This project encompasses various key components, including routes, models, middleware, configuration files, startup code, and a comprehensive testing suite. It is meticulously structured to facilitate the management of customers, genres, movies, rentals, and user authentication and authorization.

# Project Structure:
The project structure is organized into well-defined folders, each serving a specific purpose:

Routes: The routes folder serves as the core of Vidly's functionality, housing all API endpoints and route handling logic. It provides the interface for client-side interactions, enabling actions such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records for customers, genres, movies, rentals, and user-related data.

Models: Vidly's models folder contains data models that represent the core entities within the application: customers, genres, movies, rentals, and users. Each model is meticulously crafted to encapsulate the attributes and behaviors associated with its respective entity, facilitating data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

Middleware: The middleware folder plays a pivotal role in processing incoming requests and outgoing responses. Custom middleware components enhance Vidly's functionality and security, with a particular emphasis on user authentication and authorization to safeguard sensitive data and operations.

Configuration (Config) Files: The config folder contains essential configuration files that allow for environment-specific settings, such as database connections or API keys. This separation of configuration information enhances flexibility and maintainability.

Startup Code: Vidly's startup folder hosts crucial startup code that initializes the application. Here, the server is initialized, middleware is configured, and connections to external services (such as databases) are established, ensuring that the application is fully operational.

Tests: The tests folder is a testament to Vidly's commitment to quality and reliability. It includes two subfolders: "unit" and "integration." While the tests do not cover every aspect of the application, they comprehensively evaluate many critical functionalities, including authentication processes.

# Key Features and Functionality:

Customer Management: Vidly empowers users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on customer records, enabling efficient management of customer data.

Genre Classification: The application categorizes movies by genre, enhancing content organization and discoverability for users.

Movie Database: Vidly boasts an extensive movie database, allowing users to access and manage movie details, including search and filter capabilities.

Rental System: A rental system within Vidly permits users to rent movies, manage rental history, and execute rental returns efficiently.

User Authentication and Authorization: The user model focuses on user authentication and authorization, securely handling user credentials, facilitating user registration and login, and controlling access to protected routes and resources.

Testing Suite: Vidly's testing suite, comprising unit and integration tests, validates the application's functionality, ensuring robustness and reliability, with a particular emphasis on authentication processes.
